player.web
==========

Very simple music player written in Python using CherryPy and UIkit from YOOtheme. How it works? You upload some songs using web ui to server, press play button, and server plays all the files infinitely via mplayer.
For example you can use it if you want to build some sort of mass notification system or something like that...
